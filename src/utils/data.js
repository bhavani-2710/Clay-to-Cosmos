        "Once a mischievous demon named Gajamukha was cursed and turned into a tiny mouse. This little mouse was wild and uncontrollable! One day, he stumbled into Ganesha’s path and tried to wreak havoc. But Ganesha calmly trapped him under his massive foot. The mouse begged for mercy—and so, Ganesha made him his divine ride. That’s how the mighty Lord rides a humble mouse!",

When his pen broke mid-writing, Ganesha broke off his own tusk and continued writing. That’s why you often see him with one tusk—he literally gave a piece of himself for wisdom!",

A battle broke out, and Shiva beheaded him in rage. To calm Parvati, Shiva replaced his head—with that of a wise young elephant. Thus, Ganesha was reborn as the elephant-headed god of beginnings!",
